	Hey Fun Fact! I helped contribute into making a game under the game desgin company, GameHeads. I worked on the game during the summer as a Artist, UX/UI, and a little bit of Narratitve Design
            Enjoy Your Stay in Paradise is a Dialogue Click and Drag game where you play as the MC kamiya who is a Hawaiian Local that 
            serves customers in her families food truck after she became a college dropout, and started to work to make a recovery after the Maui Fires that had struck her life. Now she is making a recovery, while interacting with customer that have a idealized view of Hawaii, while she faces the harsh reality of her struggles.
            This Game is still in the making and needs much more cleaning up to do, but there will be a playable version through unity that will be update on the website when the game is finished. In the mean time I will share the rpogress of the making of the game, and steps of how Enjoy your stay in paradise was created.  <br>
