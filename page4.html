              <p class="grid-desc">For my college we had an art show for art students and I was in charge along with others
                to come up with an icon and theme name for the show. We understood that many of the artist made gamesor some kind of interactive
                interface to showcase. So I came up with the idea called "Press Play" and made the Icon along with two other students.

                <p class="grid-desc">When I was in the HER CAMPUS program in my schoo, I was in the design/program, so I was in charge with other students to make
                    flyers, update the yearly website, and make adveristments for other clubs in the school. I was assign to make a cover for the Glam Club, using canva and a
                    mox of some of my own artwork to make the Glam Club cover. They wanted a y2k theme, so I went with a hot pinkish tone. The club liked the design alot
                    and asked me to make other designs for their club meetings and flyers.

            <p class="grid-desc">This logo I had made for another game development I was part of in another intership I had the 
                opportunity of taking in Oakland. I was not only in charge of the Logo, but I was the UX/UI designer. The game is called "Enjoy
                your stay in paradise." Enjoy Your Stay In Paradise is a dialogue-driven simulation game where you play as Kamiya; 
                a spunky, hardworking young adult forced to drop out of college to work her family's food truck business after devastating 
                fires hit Maui. A year has passed since the natural disaster and the island's residents are still in recovery. Despite the community 
                struggling to piece their lives back together, the number of tourists continues to increase, leaving Kamiya with the impossible task 
                of providing them with an idyllic version of island life far from her reality.

                a minture version of myself as a stamp for my work. The logo was made by me, and for my use.
