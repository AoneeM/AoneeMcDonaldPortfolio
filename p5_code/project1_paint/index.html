<h1> Paint Tool </h1>

<p> (<strong>How it works!</strong>) To draw on the canvas, you can press numbers 1, 2, and 3. However, for some reason if you press 2 or 3 first its will draw, but the outline with be black. Unless you switch it to 1 or use the 1 key first it will change to a blue outline and forever stay a blue outline. The first two key are the same, but a different color, and will stay in the middle of the canvas, but follow the mouse.<p>
   
  <p> Draw Keys:
    1 = Yellow with blue outline/ and triangle
    2 = Pink with black outline (unless you first 1 first it will have a blue outline)
    3 = Green circles with black outline (unless you first 1 first it will have a blue outline)
    X = To erase everything (Doesn't Save)<p>
