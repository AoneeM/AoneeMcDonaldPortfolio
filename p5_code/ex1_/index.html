<h2> Canvas Control </h2>

<p> 
    This exercise was all about combining several  different examples into one full excerise. I took mainly MouseX and MouseY codes to controll the flashing of different parts of the canvas <br>

    My first thought making this code was it was pretty fun and simple code to learn and understand. When I was playing around with it, I like making the mouse move around while its chainging color, and leaving a trsil behind it. Another part I was really proud of was the fact that when I moved the mouse to different parts of the canvas it had a different function. To achieve this code you just need a bunch of shape codes that fallunder "if" staements on the canvas, and then all you do it move your mouse on certain parts of the screen
