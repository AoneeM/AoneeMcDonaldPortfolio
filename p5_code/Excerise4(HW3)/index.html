<h1> The babies got into the caffenine</h1>

<p> (<strong>INTENSE CHARACTER SHAKING!</strong>) For this excerise I make some baby classes and I coded them to move and shake intensely. I made one babyboy that would only shake its arms and legs, and I made another babygirl that shakes its whole body. The girl baby would shake violatly to the oint it leaves the screen. The boy stays and will continue to shake its arms and legs. This was a fun code to do, becuase I liked being able to mmove something with another different code besides just using mouseX and mouseY to move a character.  </p>
