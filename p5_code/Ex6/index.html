<h1> Playing around with the libraries</h1>

<p> (<strong>Nothing Even Serious LOL</strong>) In this excerise I was just telling out the libraries that we have to use for our final project so I didn't make anythign to fancy. So much sound and scene are happening its kinda annoying, but also funny. There are key switches to different scenes though/ If you press 1 you'll be taking to a scene of a ball dropping on a pole, but its not gonna move. If you press 2 it switches to a function I am gonna use later where the board is moving or using a chain collider. So, the second page is some what functionling. If you press 3 the scene switches to the collider chain that I was also thinking of using for my final project. However, when you switch the scene it makes the whole canvas go CRAZY. The press help button should work since I have been testing it. </p>
