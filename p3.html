<p>
  When there is a crazy killer on the loose going around offing
   cheerleaders there are two things you can do as a cheerleader 
   yourself. You can either sit around and look pretty, while doing a 
   cheer routine to try to convince the killer you’re too pretty to die, 
   or you can fight back and try to catch this crazy person, before either 
   you’re next or before you BECOME next victim. In this classical horror-chick series
    “Cheerleaders Cuide: To Surviving a serial killer” is a cheerful, pink, and thriller 
    series where we follow two cheerleaders in a college cheer team, on a mission to catch a 
    killer on the loose, who has a habit of targeting cheerleaders. Although they're also doing a
     routine to become the next head cheer captains. Well they need to start doing a routine on how 
     to not die in this crazy instead, classical horror scenario. However, they have no idea WHATTHEYAREDOING. 
     I mean they are cheerleaders after all. How are you supposed to nail a Competition into becoming the next 
     head of the cheerleading squad, while trying to nail the person responsible for getting rid of competition.
      During this little detective game of Who Done It, the two cheerleaders playing detective Yume, and Koko discover 
      some secrets and scandals about that cheer team, especially the main heads of the team. “Cheerleaders Guide: To 
      Surviving a serial killer” isn’t just about cute preppy cheerleaders playing detective, but it's about discovering
       secrets, and being aware of who you trust. Even if you think a person isn;t capable of something you never would 
       think they are capable of, you should always be aware of the ugly, dark, creepy truth to things.</p>
