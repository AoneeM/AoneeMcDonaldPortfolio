		<p>
	 For this 3D model that I worked on this was done for a class project were
   I had to create a monster that I came up with. So to fix my, "Cute creepy" 
   aesthetic. I made a carnivore monster, that diguises itself as a sunflower to lure its prey
   near the flower, so the Suneater can eat the prey. I used blender to make and render the model,
   To see a better picture of the model you can click on both the link and the picture!

         <h5>Biblically Accurate Heaven</h5>
		<p>
	For this 3D model I made made a landscape of my version of what Heaven could look like. I 
  am not religious, but I decide to make this after I was watching video about how Ezekiel saw angels
  , and how heaven looked. So, I added my own mix of what heaven could look like. I added like simple angels, but
  I added two biblically accurate suns. I made it shiny to give it the effect that heaven is this really 
  holy place that is shiny even at night. I used blender to make the whole thing. Click the picture and link to see another angle of the 3D model.

         <h5> Cheerleaders Guide: To survivng a serial killer</h5>
		<p>
		This project is a trialer for a series of mine called, "Cheerleaders Guide: To surviving a serial killer".
    I made this trailer when I just started making the series, and I wanted to try making 3D animation. The process was a little hard 
    since I was new to it, but I overall enjoyed making the trailer. The person in the video is a character of mind. 
    Her name is Koko who is a cheerleader, that is taking on a role of dective to find the killer in her college causing
    the dissaperences in the cheer team. I used blender for the 3D modeling, and Capcut to edit the video to add dialogue and sound.
